# Nimble Rack Assembly

The Nimble rack is built from 3d printed parts. There are some standard components, as well as custom trays for all the networking devices that you are using.

As a first step you need to 3d print the needed parts

[.](3dprintingparts.md){step}

Assembly starts with the frame:

[.](frame.md){step}

You then add the trays and the individual components to the frame:

[.](components.md){step}

The assembly is finished by doing the cabling and adding the battery

[.](finalize.md){step}
