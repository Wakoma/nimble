#  Your Nimble Configuration

The nimble is a modular rack-and-shelf system. The first part of construction is to 3D print the custom parts, and then to assemble the shelves.

The shelves in your system are:

{{listpages, tag:shelf}}

Once you have assembled each shelf, you will [construct the rack](construction.md){step}.

Make sure you have [all the parts you need]{bom}, before you start assembly.
