# Nimble example docs

This directory contains fixed documentation for all nimble racks and the templates that will be used by our orchestration script to generate complete documentation for any custom rack.

As these scripts are not yet complete please see our [example documentation repository](https://github.com/Wakoma/nimble-example-documentation).
