An open source, rapidly deployable, wireless mesh network. 

Anyone connected to the nimble can video and voice chat, stream videos, share files, build and run eLearning courses and website, create collaborative spreadsheets and documents, read e-books, play games, and so much moreâ€¦ completely offline. 

If a single internet connection is available, it can be plugged into the nimble to provide free or paid internet access to anyone on the network. The offline services and content are always available to users, regardless of internet availability.

Anyone in the world can build their own nimble with locally sourced hardware and 3D-printed components.

## State of this repository

In 2024 we received a grant from NLnet Foundation to develop a smart documentation system which automatically generates all documentation and 3D models needed for any custom nimble configuration.
