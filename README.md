An open source, rapidly deployable, wireless mesh network.

Anyone connected to the nimble can video and voice chat, stream videos, share files, build and run eLearning courses and website, create collaborative spreadsheets and documents, read e-books, play games, and so much moreâ€¦ completely offline.

If a single internet connection is available, it can be plugged into the nimble to provide free or paid internet access to anyone on the network. The offline services and content are always available to users, regardless of internet availability.

Anyone in the world can build their own nimble with locally sourced hardware and 3D-printed components.

## State of this repository

We are excited to announce that we have received a grant from NLnet Foundation! With this generous funding our team is working with several incredible partners from the open hardware community to develop a smart documentation system which automatically generates all documentation and 3D models needed for any custom nimble configuration. 

A sneek preview of the nimble builder:

This repository is in transition as we work towards the Smart-Doc goals of making all of the mechanical models parametric, and automatically generating the documentation for any configuration. To see repository before these changes, see the [post-hackathon release](https://github.com/Wakoma/nimble/releases/tag/Post-hackathon). This was the Nimble repository after the great work done at the [Open Toolchain Foundation](https://forum.opentoolchain.org/) hackathon.

For more information on our project please see:
